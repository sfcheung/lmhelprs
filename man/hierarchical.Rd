\usage{
hierarchical(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A list of the output
of \code{lm()}, that is, a list of
\code{lm}-class objects.}
}
\value{
If the models can be ordered in a
hierarchical way, the output is list
of the original list of \code{lm} outputs,
sorted from the model with the
smallest number of terms to the model
with the largest number of terms.
If the models cannot be ordered this
way, \code{NA} is returned.
}
\description{
Check a list of 'lm'
objects to see whether they are be
ordered in a way for doing
hierarchical regression analysis.
}
\details{
Two models can be compared
by hierarchical regression analysis
if one model can be formed by adding
one or more terms to the other model.

This function checks whether a list
of \code{lm} outputs can be ordered from
the simplest model to the most
complex model, with a more complex
model formed by adding one or more
terms to a simpler model.

\examples{

dat <- data_test1
lm1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, dat)
lm2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, dat)
lm3 <- lm(y ~ x1 + cat1 + cat2 + x2 + x3 + x4, dat)
lm4 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2*x3 + x4, dat)

hierarchical(lm1, lm4, lm2)
hierarchical(lm3, lm4, lm2)
